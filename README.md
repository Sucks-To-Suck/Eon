This project has been abandoned. I ran out of time, and if I ever attempt another cryptocurrency project from scratch again, 
I would likely just start over from scratch. Go is a sweet language, but I may prefer to start fresh in a lower level
language like rust, c, or zig. I made this repo public again mostly for resume purposes, to show I was attempting
interesting stuff years ago now.
