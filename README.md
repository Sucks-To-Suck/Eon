Transaction Types: (LuTx's)

0: Payout Luncheon Transaction (PLuX)
- This is the transaction that the block will give as a reward to the miner who finds it. No address the coin comes from, no scripts, and a pre-defined lock time until the miner can access it. A very simple transaction.

1: Basic Luncheon Transaction (BLuX)
- This transaction is the basic transaction that will be used for most use cases. A sender uses this to send money to a receiver, and that receivers identity is unknown until they claim it to spend down the road. 

2: Advanced Luncheon Transaction (ALuX)
- This transaction type will have a very basic scripting ability, which put simply means the transaction can have extra contingencies for the transaction to be valid. Example, the transaction will only be valid if another party pays a certin amount, and expires after 24 hours if the other person does not pay, allowing for basic contracts to be built on the platform.
