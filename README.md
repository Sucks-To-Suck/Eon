Welcome to the Luncheon Network Github!
- The following document will do the best I can to explain all of the features of Luncheon while also summerizing how it works. This document should grow and update the closer to release the project gets.

Proof of Work and Mining:
- The blockchain will be secured via a meathod called proof of work. I will explain everything you need to know about it for this in the following: Transactions are lumped together into blocks of information. The people who validate these transactions and add them to the transaction history will be mostly miners. Mining is a term used for a person who donates computational power to the network by allowing their computer to solve complex math problems. Which ever computer finds the answer to this math problem gets rewarded for it in Lunch (also called LNCH)(the token of this blockchain) and gets their list of mined transactions added to the transaction history. This method works well because if the majority are good people, the network can not be out-competed in computational power, providing a secure blockchain.

Wallets:
- Having a wallet for Luncheon will be much simplier and easier to install than last time, even if you are not participating in the network by hosting a node or mining.

What is a node:
- A node is simply the term for a computer who is apart of the Luncheon network. These computers will talk to each other about what is going on in the network, like when blocks are mined or new transactions are sent. The reason these are not called servers is because they arent. Any computer can be a node, and if the software existed, even your phone could be a node.

Security:
- This network will use many of the same mechanisms as bitcoin and ethereum for its security, and both have been very well tested over their life spans, so this blockchain should be very secure.

The Peg:
- Luncheon will no longer have a value peg to real life lunches anymore, but it still will be able to be used for that. There will not be a fixed rate at which lunches can be redeemed for now, but opportunities will arise for "bidding wars" to let the highest payer get a free lunch.
